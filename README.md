STEMBridge – Privacy Policy
Last updated: 12/4/2025
STEMBridge (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a general-audience app designed to be safe and welcoming for users of all ages, including children. We take privacy very seriously, especially for younger users.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are a parent or guardian, you consent on behalf of your child to this Policy when you allow them to use the App.
Important: This policy is a general template and does not constitute legal advice. You should have a parent/guardian and, if possible, a lawyer review it for compliance with applicable laws (such as COPPA in the U.S.).
1. Information We Collect
We aim to collect only the minimum information needed to operate and improve the App.
1.1 Information You or Your Child Provide
Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:
Account information (if applicable):
[Username, display name, and/or email address when an account is created.]
If your app does not use accounts, delete this bullet.
User content:
Content created in the App, such as [text, drawings, project descriptions, photos, or other submissions], if your app allows these.
Parent/guardian contact information (if applicable):
If we need to contact a parent or guardian for consent or notices, we may collect an email address or other contact information.
Support communications:
Information you provide when you contact us with questions, feedback, or support requests.
1.2 Information Collected Automatically
When you or your child use the App, we may automatically collect:
Device and technical information:
Device type, operating system, app version, language, and basic system information.
Usage data:
How the App is used, such as buttons clicked, screens viewed, and session duration. This helps us understand what features are popular and how to improve the App.
Log data:
IP address, crash reports, and diagnostic data to fix bugs and improve performance.
If you don’t collect some of these (e.g., IP address or analytics), remove or adjust the items above.
1.3 Information from Third-Party Services
If you use third-party services in the App (for example, [Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase, Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, or cloud storage]), we may receive limited information from them in accordance with their privacy policies.
We require these providers to handle data in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable children’s privacy laws.
2. How We Use Information
We use the information we collect to:
Operate, maintain, and improve the App and its features.
Save progress, settings, or content (so users don’t lose their work).
Fix bugs, monitor performance, and enhance security.
Communicate with parents/guardians when necessary (for example, regarding accounts, consent, or support).
Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms of use.
We do not use children’s personal information to create behavioral ad profiles.
3. Children’s Privacy
Our App is designed to be appropriate for children, but we treat children’s privacy with extra care, especially those under 13 years of age.
We do not knowingly collect more personal information from children than is reasonably necessary to use the App.
For features that require personal information from a child (such as an account or submissions that may identify them), we seek parental consent where required by law.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent (where required), we will delete that information as soon as reasonably possible.
If you believe that we might have collected personal information from a child in a way that is not allowed, please contact us at [Contact Email].
4. Parental Rights and Controls
Parents and guardians have the right to:
Review the personal information we have collected from their child.
Request that we delete their child’s personal information.
Refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child’s information.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at [Contact Email] with:
Your name and relationship to the child
The child’s username or other account identifier (if any)
Your request (review, delete, or limit collection)
We may take steps to verify your identity as a parent or guardian before fulfilling your request.
5. Sharing of Information
We do not sell personal information.
We may share information only in these limited cases:
Service providers:
With trusted third-party vendors who help us run the App (such as hosting, databases, crash reporting, or analytics). They may only use the information to perform services for us and must protect it.
Legal and safety:
When required by law, legal process, or government request; or to protect the rights, safety, or property of our users, our company, or others.
Business transfers (if applicable):
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to this Privacy Policy.
We do not allow third parties to use children’s data for their own marketing or profiling purposes.
6. Advertising
Choose the option that matches your app:
If you do NOT show ads (recommended for kids’ apps):
We do not show third-party advertising in the App.
If you show ads, but not behaviorally targeted ads:
We may show contextual ads (not based on a user’s behavior over time). We do not use children’s personal information to deliver behaviorally targeted advertisements.
7. Data Storage, Security, and Retention
We take reasonable measures to protect information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, including technical safeguards and restricted access.
However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
We keep information:
For as long as needed to provide the App and its features.
As required by law.
Until a parent/guardian requests deletion (for children’s data) or a user deletes their account, where applicable.
8. International Users
[If applicable] If you access the App from outside [Your Country/Region], your information may be processed and stored in [Country], which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. By using the App, you consent to the transfer and processing of your information in these locations.
You can remove this section if your app is clearly local and you don’t expect international users.
9. Your Rights (All Users)
Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:
Accessing the personal information we hold about you.
Requesting correction or deletion of your information.
Objecting to certain types of data processing.
Withdrawing consent when processing is based on consent.
To exercise these rights, contact us at [Contact Email].
10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top.
If we make significant changes affecting how we handle children’s data, we will take reasonable steps to notify parents/guardians (for example, through the App, by email if we have it, or through an updated notice).
Your continued use of the App after changes are posted means you accept the updated Policy.
